# ECE510

This my GitHub repo for all work done for ECE510 (HW For AI/ML). Each challenge will have their own respective directory as well as wiki page describing the challenge and my results. My project for this class will be in its own directory not labeled as a challenge with a blog like wiki page detailing my journey through creating a hardware accelerator for an AI algorithm/workload.

Most of this work was done with the help of ChatGPT as was encouraged in this course.
